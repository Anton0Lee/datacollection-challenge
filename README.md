Data Analytics Bootcamp Challenge 9  
This repo includes 2 parts of the task, one is to scrap the information from the website, second is to scrap a table form the website then proceed analysis using Pandas to create plots.  
The scraped information is stored in the json file for viewers to access. The scrapped table is presented in the Mars_dataframe file as for viewers. 
This challenge is fairly simple and straight forward. The analysis is writen for us and we only need to create the plots to support it. 
When scrapping information form the website it is important to have a good understanding the html of the website and make use of ctrl+F to find what we need. 
Some difficulty I found was creating the dataframe as it requires to store the scraped data in a list of lists.  
Another difficulty was converting object type to date type, also finding the key available for pd.plot but these can be easily resolved with internet resources.
